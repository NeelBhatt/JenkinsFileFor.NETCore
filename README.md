# Jenkins File (Groovy) For .NETCore

This project used to support some examples of jenkinsfile for pipline builds, in .NETCore.
Currently this project contains several example of using the pipeline for dotnet core

  - Pull code, Build & Run Unittest - for a specific branch
  - Pull code, Build & Run Unittest - for merging two branches


Those pipline jenkinsfile will add this pipline template to your build:
